# 🧠 Data Science Challenge Project

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow using Python, focused on cleaning, exploring, and modeling a dataset to derive actionable insights. The project was developed as part of the **Coursera "Data Science Challenge"** course.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Explore a structured dataset to identify trends and anomalies  
- Perform data cleaning and transformation  
- Build and evaluate a predictive machine learning model  
- Communicate insights and results effectively

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- Missing and skewed data significantly affected model performance
- Normalizing continuous variables improved accuracy by ~20%
- Feature importance highlighted key drivers in the dataset
- Recommended parameter tuning for future iterations

---

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for modeling and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development

---

## ⚙️ Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values using mean/mode imputation  
   - Removed outliers and normalized skewed distributions  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Uncovered correlations and trends via heatmaps, boxplots, etc.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Applied logistic regression and decision trees  
   - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, and RMSE  
   - Identified key variables with feature importance
